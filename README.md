# Easy ReadMe

## About
A very simple readme generator using Node and Inquirer, made as a challenge/homework assignment for a coding course. It will generate a simple markdown-formatted README.md file for you.

## Installation
Download the repo files and navigate to it in your terminal. Run `npm install` to get the required Node modules, then run `npm run start` to launch it.

## Usage
You'll be asked a series of questions in the console. Type in your answer for each question and hit Enter to move on to the next question. The final question asks you to choose one of three licenses using your arrow keys. Once you've answered the final question, your README.md file will be generated in the same folder as the app files.
