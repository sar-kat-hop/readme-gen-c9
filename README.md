# Easy ReadMe

## About            
A simple Node app that generates a readme.md file in markdown format using Inquirer to gather information from the user.  It's meant to hopefully streamline the process of writing a readme for new devs, especially.

## Installation 
To use this app, simply download the repo and launch your terminal from the root folder. Type `npm install` to install the required node modules. Then, run the app from your  terminal  with `npm run start`.

## Contributions
The creation of this app relied heavily on the Inquirer docs at https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer and on the course materials.
