## About
A very simple readme generator using Node and Inquirer, created as a challenge/homework assignment for a coding course. Simply answer a few questions in your terminal and the app will generate a simple markdown-formatted README.md file for you.

## Installation
Download the repo and navigate to it in your terminal. Run `npm install` to get the Node modules required. Then, run `npm run start` to launch it.
